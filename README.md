Attention has been proven successful in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, many researchers started to investigate the interpretability of attention on NLP tasks.
Many existing approaches focused on examining whether the local attention weights could
reflect the importance of input representations. In this work, we present a study on understanding the internal mechanism of attention by looking into the gradient update process,
checking its behavior when approaching a local minimum during training. We propose to
analyze for each word token the following two
quantities: its polarity score and its attention
score, where the latter is a global assessment
on the tokenâ€™s significance. We discuss conditions under which the attention mechanism
may become more (or less) interpretable, and
show how the interplay between the two quantities may impact the model performance
